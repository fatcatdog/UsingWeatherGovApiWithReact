This is a project to explore api.weather.gov and its various api endpoints.

Whats in this repo:

This create-react-app web app enables users to look up information, such as weather and timezone, about a US airport by its ICAO code (for example KATL is Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport), utilizing api.weather.gov's various APIs.

This project uses create-react-app, React, and react-router(not really utilized but its in there).

Still in progress:

-rendering local times of airports in the table

-writing JS tests for application

-refactoring giant Home component where everything lives in


I basically copied the JS to render and style the chart displayed (slightly modified it though):
