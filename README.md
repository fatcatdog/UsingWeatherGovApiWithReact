This is a project to explore using https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api and its various api endpoints.

Whats in this repo:

This web app enables users to look up information about a US airport, by its ICAO code (for example KATL is Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport), utilizing api.weather.gov's various APIs.

This project uses React and react-router(not really utilized but its in there).

Still in progress:

-rendering local times of airports in the table
-writing JS tests for application
-refactoring giant Home component where everything lives in


I basically copied the JS to render and style the chart displayed (slightly modified it though):
